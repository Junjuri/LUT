Fig. 2: The example of VECTOR-8 architecture used in this study. Convolutional layers in the encoder and transposed convolutional layers in the decoder are symmetric i.e., the input dimension to the convolutional layer and the output dimension to the paired transposed convolutional layer are the same.
